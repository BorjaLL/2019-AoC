Advent of Code solutions

Summary:

Day 1 was quite simple, did it in excel in my offtime and I was hooked.

Day 2 was horrible, could not do it with just excel and my SQL knowledge was not that deep. So I proceeded to install a database and get learning!

Day 3 took more time to think about a solution than to get it working. 

Day 4 had some weird instructions that took me some time to understand correctly. I looked at the subreddit and that confused me even more.

Day 5 was a blast, very logical and the solution was clear. some mistakes took a long time to track down due to the bad debugging in SQL. I ended up having a version of the code that passed all the tests but did not complete the full task.

Day 6 The orbits were so much fun. it felt like SQL was the perfect language for this.

Day 7 ugh, more intcode debugging again. had to learn to create procedures!

Day 8 was fun to do this in a plane with excel, plane and simple if you will

Day 9 was decevingly simple. had to do a lot of debugging for the 203 and 204 and part 2 took 772 seconds to complete which made me waste 2 hours looking for errors where there was none.

Day 10 was horrible, I managed to get a solution for part 1 that was off by 1 number because I was not counting the prime number 7. that solution did not work for part 2. I had to revisit trigonometry and implement the ATAN2 formula, in the end I was also off by 1 number, the correct answer was in my position 199. It is frustrating when the solution passes the tests and it fails the final input. I'm learning a lot about debugging.

Day 11 my Intcode machine is becoming very slow, the first code I wrote was OK but spent some hours trying to see what was wrong because the shape it was creating didnt seem like it was on purpouse. after seeing some solutions in the subreddit it turned out it was expected behaviour. I got part 2 for free during part one by not resetting the HULL table between tries and the robot started on a white position.

Day 12 was tempting working with strings but i would have had to find "," to separate them on each go. I did try not to write anything to the DB in this exercise.
