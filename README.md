Advent of Code solutions

Summary:

Day 1 was quite simple, did it in excel in my offtime and I was hooked.

Day 2 was horrible, could not do it with just excel and my SQL knowledge was not that deep. So I proceeded to install a database and get learning!

Day 3 took more time to think about a solution than to get it working. 

Day 4 had some weird instructions that took me some time to understand correctly. I looked at the subreddit and that confused me even more.

Day 5 was a blast, very logical and the solution was clear. some mistakes took a long time to track down due to the bad debugging in SQL. I ended up having a version of the code that passed all the tests but did not complete the full task.

Day 6 The orbits were so much fun. it felt like SQL was the perfect language for this.

Day 7 ugh, more intcode debugging again. had to learn to create procedures!

Day 8 was fun to do this in a plane with excel, plane and simple if you will

Day 9 was decevingly simple. had to do a lot of debugging for the 203 and 204 and part 2 took 772 seconds to complete which made me waste 2 hours looking for errors where there was none.
