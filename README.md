Advent of Code solutions

Summary:

Day 1 was quite simple, did it in excel in my offtime and I was hooked.

Day 2 was horrible, could not do it with just excel and my SQL knowledge was not that deep. So I proceeded to install a database and get learning!

Day 3 took more time to think about a solution than to get it working. 

Day 4 had some weird instructions that took me some time to understand correctly. I looked at the subreddit and that confused me even more.

Day 5 was a blast, very logical and the solution was clear. some mistakes took a long time to track down due to the bad debugging in SQL. I ended up having a version of the code that passed all the tests but did not complete the full task.
